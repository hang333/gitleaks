# This config contains a single rule that checks for AWS keys. However, it also contains a whitelist table
# where you can define one or more whitelists. What this means is that if you have an example AWS key as part of your
# code (in a test for example), then you can whitelist that specific key so gitleaks will not label it as a leak.
# If this line was present in a git history: `aws_access_key_id='AKIAIO5FODNN7EXAMPLE``, gitleaks would match this line
# with the rule below, but since we have a whitelist against that specific key, it would be ignored.
